# Technologies 
Back in 2016 I made this project in Netbeans using **Java** and **Ant** as package manager (selecting 'java application').

# Project Constraints

* The project you be a desktop app. 
* The project should hava a User interface BUT you CANT use the drag and drop option from Netbeans, all Buttons and interface 
should be programmed using Jframe, JMenu, Jbutton, etc (Drag and drop was 100% forbidden). 
* The project should use a look and feel library to make the UI more appealing.
